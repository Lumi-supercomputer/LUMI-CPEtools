.SH NAME
LUMI-CPEtools \- Various CPE-dependent tools, e.g., to test process and thread
affinity.

.SH DESCRIPTION
CPEtools contains various small tools to check which libraries a program links
to or to experiment how programs of various types would start on LUMI to
refine batch scripts. Some tools are specific for a particular CPE.

Commands:
.TP
\fBxldd\fR
An ldd-like program to show which versions of Cray PE libraries are used by an
executable.

.TP
\fBserial_check\fR
Serial program can print core and host allocation and affinity information.

.TP
\fBomp_check\fR
OpenMP program can print core and host allocation and affinity information.

.TP
\fBmpi_check\fR
MPI program can print core and host allocation and affinity information.
It is also suitable to test heterogeneous jobs.

.TP
\fBhybrid_check\fR
Hybrid MPI/OpenMP program can print core and host allocation and affinity information.
It is also suitable to test heterogeneous jobs.
It encompasses the full functionality of \fBserial_check\fR, \fBomp_check\fR and
\fBmpi_check\fR.

.SH SEE ALSO
xldd(1), serial_check(1), omp_check(1), mpi_check(1), hybrid_check(1)
